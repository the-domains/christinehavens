# About ![Christine Havens](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/43fcac88-5a62-4762-9fed-ad05fb51ce13.jpg)

Christine Havens is a wine writer and former winemaker who has become a [Vivino][0]
power user with over 35,000 followers largely thanks to her wine 
ratings. An early adopter, Ms. Havens has been sharing her reviews with 
fellow users since the app hit the US market in late fall 2011\. She also
frequently contributes articles and wine pairing recommendations to the
news section of the app.

A fine artist and bronze sculptor by trade, Ms. Havens' wine journey 
began with a chance meeting in early 2002, when Stan Clarke, the 
founding Associate Director of the Enology and Viticulture Program at 
Walla Walla Community College invited her to attend one of his lectures.
She turned up with no expectations and very little knowledge of 
wine---the semester had already been in session for a week. After the 
class, Mr. Clarke asked her what she thought of the lecture, "I'm pretty
sure we can find a way to get you some vocational retraining money if 
you decide to enroll."

After completing the Viticulture and Enology program in 2004, she 
relocated to the small but picturesque town of Pullman, Washington, 
where she founded a small winery with her (now) ex and his family. 
Between 2004 and 2011, she honed her winemaking style, experimenting 
with Rhȏne and Bordeaux varieties, she specialized in blends that were 
well received in the local market. She maintained contracts with many of
the same vineyards she interned in, and sourced fruit from some of the 
most distinctive AVAs in the state, including Walla Walla Valley, Snipes
Mountain and Yakima Valley. Of note, she was the first winemaker to 
have created a private label for Washington State University.

Later she moved into retail for two years, with a particular focus on
the grand cru classé estates of Bordeaux. Her love of Old World wines 
has since fueled her writing career. In 2014 she left her day job to 
write about wines full time, her background in winegrowing and 
winemaking have endowed her with technical knowledge and a deep 
appreciation for the process. In addition to her reviews, she currently 
writes for [The SOMM Journal][1] and is also a Network Advisory Ambassador for [WineVine.tv,][2] as well as a [\#winelover][3]
specialist. She has recently earned an Award in Wines & Spirits 
Educational Trust Level 3 Advanced Certificate.

Ms. Havens currently lives in Portland, Oregon.
