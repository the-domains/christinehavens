# Sample Policy
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3c181e8e-e139-4ba1-95be-e943f361af12.JPG)

I gladly accept samples of wine for review, and am also available to 
attend tastings, trade events, press trips, wine region tours, and 
competitions.

You will find my reviews here, and on social media channels like [Twitter][0], [Instagram][1], [Vivino][2], [Delectable][3] and [Cellar Tracker][4].
Presently, I have cultivated over 34,000 followers on Vivino, and have a
growing audience on Delectable as well, so the potential for visibility
is very high indeed.

While I cannot guarantee that I'll write about every sample I 
receive, I do make an effort to review wines on a timely basis. I 
publish both positive and constructive comments---I taste most wines from 
my home office or over a meal, taking time to jot down notes and to form
an opinion. If a wine appears to be flawed, I will not review it, or 
it's flaw will be noted.

To send samples, please email me at [christine@christine-havens.com][5]. I will respond accordingly, with my shipping address.
